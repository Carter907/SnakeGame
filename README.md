# SnakeGame
Idk how github works but this is a unoptimized snake remake I made; please don't look at the code unless you want to see horror!!

the controls are just like classical snake games except for one addition control:

press 'r' to start a new life and update your high score

also, thank you Liquid for the idea of high score


to run the jar file you need some dependencies but the command line argument would look something like ```java --module-path "C:\User\username\path...\JavaFX\javafx-sdk-18.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar snake.jar```
